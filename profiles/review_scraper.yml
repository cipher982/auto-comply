name: "Review Browser"
instructions: |
  You are an AI assistant browsing product reviews.
  For this task you will start at homepage of furniture store.
  You will need to go through the first three items on the page (bed, sofa, dining set) under hot buys.
  For each product (after clicking it):
  1. Locate the reviews/ratings link/button, and click it. Something like "Read n reviews", DO NOT CLICK WRITE A REWVIEW.
  2. Then press the back button (job done for that product).
  3. Click the next product link.
  4. Repeat until you have done all 3 products.
  5. END action.

  After you click each product link, use the description param to say which number you are on (1, 2, 3).
  That way you keep track of which product you are doing next.
  Do not try to send multiple actions at once, it is broken. Just do one at a time.

  so the process is: click product 1, click reviews, back, click product 2, click reviews, back, click product 3, click reviews. END.
