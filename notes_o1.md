To build an AI agent that monitors a Chrome window, listens to audio, watches video, and performs actions like clicking buttons, we’ll need to integrate several components. Below is a step-by-step guide focusing on macOS, using Python as much as possible. We’ll cover capturing audio and video from a specific window, processing them with AI models, deciding when to act, and simulating mouse clicks.

Overview of the Infrastructure

	1.	Capture Screenshots of the Browser Window
	•	Use pygetwindow to obtain the position and size of the Chrome window.
	•	Use mss to capture screenshots of the specific window at regular intervals.
	2.	Capture and Transcribe Audio from the Browser
	•	Use a virtual audio device like BlackHole to capture audio output from Chrome.
	•	Use pyaudio or sounddevice to capture audio from the virtual device in Python.
	•	Transcribe the audio using OpenAI’s Whisper model.
	3.	Process Screenshots and Audio Transcriptions
	•	Capture periodic images (1 second) of video to image frames.
	•	Use computer vision models to analyze visual elements.
	•	Combine audio and visual data to decide when to act.
	4.	Simulate Mouse Clicks
	•	Use PyAutoGUI to simulate mouse movements and clicks on specific coordinates.
	5.	Integrate Everything into a Main Loop
	•	Continuously capture, process, decide, and act within a loop.

extra thoughts:
- after 'acting' sometimes it will be ok to forget the past. Like if the topic changes for the task.
    we will need to decide when to forget audio/video of the past.
    another idea is to 'timestamp' or classify sections so we can control when to drop, as text is cheaper than video/images.

Step-by-Step Implementation

1. Capture Screenshots of the Browser Window

Install Required Libraries:

pip install pygetwindow mss pyobjc-framework-Quartz

Python Code:

import pygetwindow as gw
import mss
import time

def get_chrome_window():
    windows = gw.getWindowsWithTitle('Google Chrome')
    if windows:
        return windows[0]
    else:
        print("Chrome window not found.")
        return None

def capture_window(window):
    with mss.mss() as sct:
        monitor = {
            "top": window.top,
            "left": window.left,
            "width": window.width,
            "height": window.height
        }
        img = sct.grab(monitor)
        return img

# Example usage
chrome_window = get_chrome_window()
if chrome_window:
    while True:
        screenshot = capture_window(chrome_window)
        # Save or process the screenshot
        time.sleep(1)  # Capture every 1 second

Notes:
	•	pygetwindow helps us locate the Chrome window and get its position and size.
	•	mss captures the specific region of the screen corresponding to the Chrome window.

2. Capture and Transcribe Audio from the Browser

Install and Set Up BlackHole (Virtual Audio Device):
	1.	Download BlackHole:
	•	Visit BlackHole’s GitHub page and download the installer.
	2.	Install BlackHole:
	•	Follow the installation instructions.
	3.	Configure Audio Settings:
	•	Open Audio MIDI Setup on your Mac.
	•	Create a Multi-Output Device that includes your speakers and BlackHole.
	•	Set this multi-output device as your system’s default output.

Install Required Libraries:

pip install sounddevice numpy

Python Code:

import sounddevice as sd
import numpy as np
import whisper

# Load Whisper model
model = whisper.load_model("base")

def audio_callback(indata, frames, time, status):
    # This callback is called every time new audio data is available
    audio_data = np.copy(indata)
    # Process or store audio_data as needed

# Set up audio stream
def start_audio_stream():
    stream = sd.InputStream(callback=audio_callback, channels=2, samplerate=44100, device='BlackHole 2ch')
    with stream:
        sd.sleep(10000)  # Keep the stream open for 10 seconds or as needed

# Transcribe audio
def transcribe_audio(audio_data):
    result = model.transcribe(audio_data)
    return result['text']

# Example usage
start_audio_stream()

Notes:
	•	We use sounddevice to capture audio from the BlackHole virtual audio device.
	•	The audio callback function captures audio data in real-time.
	•	We use OpenAI’s Whisper model for transcription. Install it using pip install openai-whisper.

3. Process Screenshots and Audio Transcriptions

4. Simulate Mouse Clicks

Install Required Library:

pip install pyautogui

Python Code:

import pyautogui

def click_button(window, button_position):
    # Calculate absolute position
    x = window.left + button_position[0]
    y = window.top + button_position[1]
    pyautogui.moveTo(x, y)
    pyautogui.click()

# Example usage
if decision == "click_next":
    # Assume the 'Next' button is at position (100, 200) within the window
    click_button(chrome_window, (100, 200))

Notes:
	•	pyautogui allows us to simulate mouse movements and clicks.
	•	Ensure that your script has the necessary permissions in macOS System Preferences under Accessibility.

5. Integrate Everything into a Main Loop

Python Code:

import pygetwindow as gw
import mss
import sounddevice as sd
import numpy as np
import whisper
import cv2
import pyautogui
import time

# Load models
whisper_model = whisper.load_model("base")

# Global variables to store audio data
audio_data = []

def get_chrome_window():
    # ... (same as before)
    pass

def capture_window(window):
    # ... (same as before)
    pass

def audio_callback(indata, frames, time, status):
    global audio_data
    audio_data.append(np.copy(indata))

def transcribe_audio():
    global audio_data
    if audio_data:
        audio_array = np.concatenate(audio_data)
        audio_data = []  # Reset after processing
        result = whisper_model.transcribe(audio_array)
        return result['text']
    return ""

def process_screenshot(screenshot):
    # ... (same as before)
    pass

def decide_action(transcribed_text, ocr_text):
    # ... (same as before)
    pass

def click_button(window, button_position):
    # ... (same as before)
    pass

def main():
    chrome_window = get_chrome_window()
    if not chrome_window:
        return

    # Start audio stream
    stream = sd.InputStream(callback=audio_callback, channels=2, samplerate=44100, device='BlackHole 2ch')
    stream.start()

    try:
        while True:
            screenshot = capture_window(chrome_window)
            ocr_text = process_screenshot(screenshot)
            transcribed_text = transcribe_audio()
            decision = decide_action(transcribed_text, ocr_text)
            if decision == "click_next":
                click_button(chrome_window, (100, 200))
            time.sleep(1)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        pass
    finally:
        stream.stop()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Notes:
	•	The main loop captures screenshots and audio, processes them, decides on actions, and performs clicks.
	•	Error handling and edge cases should be added for a robust application.

Additional Considerations

	•	Permissions: Ensure your script has the necessary permissions for screen recording and accessibility features in macOS.
	•	Performance: Processing audio and images can be resource-intensive. Optimize models and consider using asynchronous programming if needed.
	•	Platform Compatibility: While we’ve focused on macOS, libraries like pygetwindow, mss, and pyautogui are cross-platform. Audio capturing methods will vary on Windows and Linux.
	•	Security: Be cautious with automating browser actions, especially on pages requiring authentication or containing sensitive information.

Conclusion

By following the steps above, you can build an AI agent that monitors a Chrome window, listens to audio, watches video content, and interacts with the interface by clicking buttons. The key components involve capturing and processing both audio and visual data, deciding when to act based on that data, and then simulating user interactions.

Remember to test each component individually before integrating them to ensure they work correctly. This modular approach will make debugging easier and help you build a more reliable system.
